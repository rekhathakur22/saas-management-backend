# What is a SaaS Management System?
A SaaS Management System is a web application that helps companies track, manage, and control all software applications used within the organization. It stores information such as software licenses, pricing, subscription plans, usage details, and the employees assigned to each software.

# What problems does this backend solve?

This backend provides a centralized system to manage data related to all SaaS tools used by a company. It helps eliminate scattered information, reduces manual tracking, prevents unnecessary license costs, and gives administrators clear visibility into software usage and expenses.

# What type of users will use this system?

The system supports multiple types of users, including:

Admins – who manage organizations, software, licenses, users, and subscriptions

Employees – who are assigned software and can view the tools they are using

(Additional roles like managers or finance users can be added later.)


# What responsibilities does the backend have?

The backend is responsible for:

Authentication – verifying user identity (login, signup)

Authorization – controlling access based on user roles

Managing software data (name, license type, cost, vendor)

Tracking license usage and assigned employees

Handling subscription and pricing information

Storing and updating employee–software relationships

Providing secure APIs for the frontend
